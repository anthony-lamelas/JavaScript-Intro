# JavaScript Projects â€“ freeCodeCamp

This repository contains my completed exercises and mini-projects from the **Introduction to JavaScript** course on freeCodeCamp.

These projects and scripts helped me learn the basics of JavaScript programming, including:

- Variables and data types
- Functions and scope
- Arrays and objects
- Loops and conditionals
- Basic DOM manipulation

## Highlights:
- Interactive function challenges  
- Algorithm scripting practice  
- Small browser-based interactions

All code follows the structure and lessons taught in the freeCodeCamp JavaScript curriculum.
